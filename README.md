Patient Management System

This C program provides basic patient management functionality for healthcare institutions. It enables users to manage patient records, including adding new patients, editing test results, searching for patients by ID, and identifying patients diagnosed with diabetes based on test results.

Notes:

Patient data is stored in a text file named "Patient.txt" with a specific format (ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Test1, Test2, Test3).
The program provides basic functionalities and can be extended and improved to meet more advanced healthcare management needs.
Input validation and error handling are limited in this program for simplicity. It assumes valid input in most cases.
This program serves as a starting point and can be further developed for more comprehensive patient management systems.
